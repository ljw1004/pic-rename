This is to rename all the selected folder's photos and videos to names of the form <code style="background-color:cyan;">Date - Time - Place.ext</code>.
<ul>
<li><strong>Why do this?</strong> Some people find it easier if their photo filenames show when+where.</li>
<li><strong>This is slow!</strong> It takes ~10s/file, mainly just downloading the file from OneDrive. Maybe leave it running overnight...</li>
<li><strong>It only works for phones+cameras.</strong>. It looks for the metadata recorded by the phone/camera about when and where the photo was taken. (This metadata is absent from photoshop'd files, and screenshots, and many online files).</li>
